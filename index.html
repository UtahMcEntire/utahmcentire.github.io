			I'm currently a sophomore at MTSU working towards a Bachelor's of Science in Computer Science, on track to graduate in 2021. I'm most knowledgeable in C++, but very familiar with HTML, CSS, and Python as well. In 2016 finished a 5-year enlistment in the US Navy stationed in Pearl Harbor as an Electronics Technician. The majority of my time was spent maintaining and troubleshooting external long-range communication systems onboard USS Hopper. I have extensive knowledge in electronic theory, advanced troubleshooting methods, and gained leadership experience during my service as well. I look forward to furthering my career in technology and connecting with the people in it.
